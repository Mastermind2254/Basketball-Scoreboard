## 💡 Inspiration & Credits

This project was part of a **Scrimba** learning path that helped me grasp the foundations of front-end development. Huge shoutout to the Scrimba instructors — you're the real MVPs! 🏆

The UI design was inspired by a **Figma** template provided in the course. It helped me understand the connection between design tools and actual code, which was a big 'aha!' moment.
